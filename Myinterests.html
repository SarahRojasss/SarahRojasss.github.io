<h1>INTERESTS</h1>
<p> My main interests lie withing watching movies or tv shows, listening to songs, and, what is arguably my largest interest, reading.</p>

<h2> MOVIES AND TV-SHOWS </h2>
<p>I enjoy watching movies and tv-shows, especially with family, because I am hugely absorbed in stories and the development that goes along with them. I also enjoy guessing what will happen in the movies, and it makes me unnecessarily ecstatic when I end up being correct about a certain outcome. </p>

<h2> SONGS </h2>
<p>Similarly to movies, songs allow me to experience human emotions in a quicker span of time. For example, when I listen to Taylor Swift, by paying attention to her lyrics, I feel emerged into her story and it makes me feel as though I have gone through them myself. These can be expressed as heartbreak, friendship bonds, and love songs. </p>

<h2> READING </h2>
<p>Lastly, but most importantly, reading is more special to me than any other activities I partake in because I ache for that feeling of entertainment, drama, and suspense, Which, although is also available through movies, seems more realistic when reading as I get to imagine what everything and everyone looks like.</p>
